# Subroutines aka Functions
reusable piece of code that can be called to perform various repeatable tasks.
- declared using label (_start, etc)
- instruction CALL to call the subroutine
- instruction RET to return the value

## Stack
- is a special type of memory
- order : Last In First Out
- we need to use stack when we call subroutines to temporary store values that will be restored later.
