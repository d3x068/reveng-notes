PE and ELF.
# What focus on :
- sections in executables: Learn about the .text (code), .data (data), and .bss (uninitialized data) sections.
- Headers and Symbol Tables: Understand how headers provide metadata about the executable and how symbols are used to link functions and variables.
- Static vs Dynamic Linking: Learn the difference between statically linked and dynamically linked binaries and how libraries are loaded.
