Windows and Linux Internals
What to Focus On:
1. Process and Memory Management: Learn how processes are created, managed, and terminated. Understand virtual memory, paging, and memory protection.
2. System Calls and Interrupts: Understand how user-mode programs interact with the kernel via system calls.
3. Dynamic Linking and Loaders: Understand how libraries are loaded at runtime using mechanisms like ld.so (Linux) and LoadLibrary() (Windows).
