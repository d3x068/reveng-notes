# Intro to Assembly Language
Each assembly language instruction represents one machine instruction, and it depends on the CPU architecture (x86, ARM, etc).

## Key Concepts
### Registers
small, fast storage locations in the CPU used for operations. Common registers in x86 :
- EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX : general purpose registers
- ESP : stack pointer.
- EBP : base pointer.
- EIP : instruction pointer.
### Instructions
### Memory Addressing
### Stack
### Flags
